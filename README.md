# Need cooperation
Because of my poor linguistic ability, anyone please touch up translate text for English and Russian with editing lang_en.json/lang_ru.json file under "static/js/language/".
And also anyone please try to create new JSON files for the other language(Thai(th), and more!) by modifying from lang_ja.json.
